    <h1>Privacy Policy for Yoruk App</h1>
    <p>Thank you for using Yoruk, a GPS-based path tracking and direction-finding application. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the app collects, uses, and protects your data.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Yoruk does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The application processes your device's location data locally and temporarily for the purpose of displaying information on your screen.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Location Data</h2>
    <p>Yoruk uses GPS signals to determine your location and direction of movement.</p>
    <p>All location data is processed on your device only. It is not recorded, stored, or transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>3. No Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>The application operates entirely offline.</p>
    <p>It does not access the internet and therefore does not send or receive any data over a network.</p>
    <p>Due to the lack of internet usage, map services are not available.</p>

    <h2>4. Background Operation</h2>
    <p>Yoruk may continue to run in the background to provide continuous GPS-based tracking, but no data is retained or transmitted.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated as needed. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated effective date.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:yoruk.support@protonmail.com">yoruk.support@protonmail.com</a></p>
