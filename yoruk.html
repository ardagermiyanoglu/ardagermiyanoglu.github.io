<h1>Yoruk - Offline GPS Tracker</h1>

<p>Offline GPS tracking app without internet or compass. Does not include maps.</p>

<p>The app does not include maps.</p>

<p>"Yörük" is a Turkish word for a nomad — someone who travels through nature without staying in one place, just like how this GPS app tracks your path anywhere, even without maps or internet.</p>

<p>Works Fully Offline</p>
<p>"Yoruk" does not require any internet connection. It operates entirely on GPS signals, making it ideal for use in areas with no mobile network or Wi-Fi—such as mountains, forests, seas, or during emergencies.</p>

<p>No Compass Needed</p>
<p>Unlike many navigation apps, "Yoruk" does not rely on your device’s compass sensor. It calculates your movement direction using your latest GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). When stationary, it does not show real-time direction.</p>

<p>Accurate GPS Path Tracking</p>
<p>Continuously tracks your location using GPS</p>
<p>Records your route visually</p>
<p>Runs in the background if needed</p>
<p>No data is saved or transmitted</p>
<p>Your location is used only for on-screen display</p>

<p>Privacy First</p>
<p>"Yoruk" does not collect, store, or share your location or any personal data. All data stays on your device.</p>
<p>No Maps, No Internet Dependency</p>
<p>Because the app is completely offline, there is no map display. This makes the app faster, simpler, and usable even in the most remote areas.</p>

<p>Perfect for:</p>
<p>Outdoor adventures (hiking, trekking, camping)</p>
<p>Sea navigation</p>
<p>Emergency situations with no signal</p>
<p>Battery-efficient, simple navigation without distractions</p>

<p>Lightweight, fast, and privacy-respecting — "Yoruk" is your reliable GPS guide when you need it the most.</p>
