    <p><strong>Find your way back — even without signal. Lightweight, privacy-first offline GPS tracker for outdoor, emergency, and tactical use.</strong></p>

    <p><em>"Yörük"</em> is a Turkish word for a nomad — someone who roams nature without settling, just like this app helps you move freely and safely in offline environments.</p>

    <h2>Navigate Back Without Internet or Maps</h2>
    <p><strong>Yoruk</strong> tracks your path using only your device's GPS and compass sensors. Whether you're in a forest, deep in the mountains, on the sea, or in an emergency zone, it helps you return to where you started — all without internet, mobile signal, or maps.</p>

    <p>As you walk, your path is recorded and displayed visually. Using this path, you can retrace your steps even in the most remote areas. The app does not display maps; this is a deliberate design choice to ensure full independence from internet or signal availability.</p>
