    <p><strong>Offline GPS tracking app without internet or compass. No maps included.</strong></p>

    <p><em>"Yörük"</em> is a Turkish word for a nomad — someone who travels through nature without staying in one place, just like how this GPS app tracks your path anywhere, even without maps or internet.</p>

    <h2>Works Fully Offline</h2>
    <p><strong>Yoruk</strong> does not require any internet connection. It operates entirely on GPS signals, making it ideal for use in areas with no mobile network or Wi-Fi — such as mountains, forests, seas, or during emergencies.</p>

    <h2>No Compass Needed</h2>
    <p>Unlike many navigation apps, <strong>Yoruk</strong> does not rely on your device’s compass sensor. It calculates your movement direction using your latest GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).</p>
    <p>When stationary, it does not show real-time direction.</p>

    <h2>Accurate GPS Path Tracking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Continuously tracks your location using GPS</li>
        <li>Records your route visually</li>
        <li>Runs in the background if needed</li>
        <li>No data is saved or transmitted</li>
        <li>Your location is used only for on-screen display</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy First</h2>
    <p><strong>Yoruk</strong> does not collect, store, or share your location or any personal data. All data stays on your device.</p>

    <h2>No Maps, No Internet Dependency</h2>
    <p>Because the app is completely offline, there is no map display. This makes the app faster, simpler, and usable even in the most remote areas.</p>

    <h2>Perfect For:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Outdoor adventures (hiking, trekking, camping)</li>
        <li>Sea navigation</li>
        <li>Emergency situations with no signal</li>
        <li>Battery-efficient, simple navigation without distractions</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Lightweight, fast, and privacy-respecting — "Yoruk" is your reliable GPS guide when you need it the most.</strong></p>
